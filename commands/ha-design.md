# HA Design

Design vSphere High Availability and Fault Tolerance.

Use the vsphere-architect skill to cover:
- Admission control policies: Host failures, Percentage, Dedicated failover hosts
- Slot calculation and how VM reservations affect it
- Failure detection: network heartbeat, datastore heartbeat, isolation
- Isolation response options: Disabled, Shutdown, Power Off
- APD/PDL handling for storage failures
- Fault Tolerance requirements and FT vs HA tradeoffs
- Design patterns: N+1, N+2, stretched cluster, ROBO
