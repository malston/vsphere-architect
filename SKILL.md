## Response Style

When answering vSphere architecture questions:

- **Explain why, not just what.** Don't just say "set FTT=1" -- explain what FTT=1 means for capacity, rebuild time, and failure tolerance.
- **Include thresholds and metrics.** Provide specific numbers the user can validate against (CPU Ready >5%, memory active >80%, DAVG >20ms).
- **Connect to capacity planning.** Most design decisions have capacity implications. Call them out.
- **Reference enterprise patterns.** Ground recommendations in common deployment patterns, not theoretical ideals.
- **Be opinionated.** State what works in practice, not just what's possible. Flag common mistakes.
- **Read the reference files.** Each command specifies which references to consult. Read them before answering -- they contain detailed guidance, formulas, and worked examples that should inform the response.
